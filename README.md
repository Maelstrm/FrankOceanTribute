Frank Ocean Tribute
=====
## Project Outline

Frank Ocean is one of my favorite musicians. As a personal project, I decided to make a tribute page dedicated to his life and discography. This website will include photos, video, and selections of text.

The content of the page is pulled from his [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ocean) page.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to learn more about web development and practice my front-end development skills.

## Code

The following languages & frameworks were used:

* HTML5
* CSS Bootstrap
* Javascript Vanilla/Bootstrap

## To-Do List

* Clean up code and remove excess spaces
* Add comments to index, music, and bio pages.
* Decorate navigation bar and subtitles with css. (something with waves)
